The loan analysis project predicts whether someone is going to pay back their loan based on a number of different features.
This project goes through the data cleaning, feature preparation, and machine learning implementation process. 
I use a logistic regression model as well as cross validation techniques to evaluate my model.

The car price prediction project predicts the price of a car based on several different features of the car.
This project implements the k-nearest-neighbor algorithm and also uses cross validation to measure the accuracy of the model.
